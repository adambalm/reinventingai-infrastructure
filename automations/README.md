# Automation Management

Client automation templates and configurations for workflow deployment.

## Structure

**templates/**  
Reusable automation patterns and workflow templates.

**clients/**  
Client-specific configurations and customized workflows.

## Template Development

Templates should be generic and parameterized to allow easy customization for different clients.

## Client Configuration

Each client should have a dedicated subdirectory with:
- Configuration files
- Custom workflow definitions  
- Client-specific documentation

## Deployment Process

1. Select appropriate template
2. Create client-specific configuration
3. Deploy to n8n instance
4. Test workflow functionality
5. Document client-specific modifications

## Best Practices

- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Document all custom modifications
- Test templates before client deployment
- Maintain version control for client configs
