# Docker CPU Incident Report
**Date:** July 31, 2025  
**Time:** 12:42 PM EST  
**Severity:** High (System Impact)  
**Status:** Resolved  

## Executive Summary
Docker Desktop experienced a critical performance issue consuming 687% CPU usage, rendering the Mac system nearly unusable. The issue was successfully resolved with zero data loss and minimal service interruption.

## Incident Timeline
- **12:42 PM** - Issue detected: Docker Desktop CPU usage at 667%
- **12:43 PM** - Diagnostic phase initiated with data protection protocols
- **12:45 PM** - Root cause identified: Runaway Docker backend process (PID 25066)
- **12:47 PM** - Process terminated and Docker Desktop restarted
- **12:49 PM** - All services restored, CPU usage normalized to 75% idle

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause
A single Docker Desktop backend process (`com.docker.backend run`) became stuck in a resource-intensive loop, consuming 687.2% CPU continuously.

### Differential Diagnosis
**What it WAS:**
- Docker Desktop backend daemon malfunction
- Likely related to filesystem sync operations with macOS
- Possibly triggered by volume operations or container lifecycle events

**What it was NOT:**
- Container applications themselves (n8n, cloudflared running normally at <1% CPU)
- System-wide resource exhaustion
- Network connectivity issues
- Storage capacity problems
- Memory leaks (containers used normal ~400MB each)

### Contributing Factors
1. **Long-running containers**: n8n-gabe running for 21 hours may have triggered sync issues
2. **Volume operations**: Persistent data volumes may have caused filesystem conflicts
3. **macOS integration**: Docker Desktop's tight macOS integration can create resource conflicts

## Impact Assessment

### System Impact
- **High**: Mac system load average reached 14.03 (normal <2.0)
- **High**: Overall CPU utilization >90% (687% from single process)
- **Medium**: System responsiveness severely degraded

### Service Impact
- **None**: All containers continued running normally
- **None**: No data loss or corruption
- **Minimal**: ~2-3 minutes of service interruption during restart

### Data Integrity
✅ **CONFIRMED SAFE**: 
- n8n volume `n8n_data_gabe` fully intact (7.031MB preserved)
- All container configurations preserved
- No workflow interruptions post-restart

## Resolution Steps Implemented

### Immediate Actions
1. **Process Termination**: Killed runaway Docker backend process (PID 25066)
2. **Service Restart**: Restarted Docker Desktop application
3. **Container Recovery**: All containers auto-restarted via `restart: unless-stopped`
4. **Health Verification**: Confirmed all services healthy via health checks

### Verification Steps
- Container status: All 3 containers running (n8n-gabe, n8n-ed, cloudflared-gabe)
- Resource usage: CPU normalized to <1% per container
- Data integrity: n8n volume intact and accessible
- Service endpoints: Health checks returning HTTP 200 {"status":"ok"}
- System performance: Load average dropped from 14.03 to 2.89

## Preventive Measures & Recommendations

### Immediate (Implemented)
1. **Monitoring**: Established baseline CPU usage monitoring
2. **Documentation**: Created this incident report for future reference

### Short-term (Recommended)
1. **Resource Limits**: Configure Docker Desktop CPU/memory limits
2. **Health Monitoring**: Implement automated Docker daemon health checks
3. **Alert System**: Set up CPU usage alerts >200% for early detection

### Long-term (Recommended)
1. **Alternative Solutions**: Consider Docker alternatives (Colima, Podman) for Mac
2. **Container Orchestration**: Evaluate moving to production Kubernetes
3. **Backup Automation**: Implement scheduled n8n data backups

## Technical Specifications

### Environment Details
- **Platform**: macOS Darwin 21.6.0
- **Docker Version**: Docker Desktop (latest)
- **Container Runtime**: containerd
- **Critical Volumes**: n8n_data_gabe (external, persistent)

### Performance Metrics
| Metric | Before | After | Status |
|--------|---------|-------|---------|
| Docker CPU | 687.2% | <1% | ✅ Fixed |
| System Load | 14.03 | 2.89 | ✅ Fixed |
| System Idle | 9.74% | 75.95% | ✅ Fixed |
| n8n Response | Degraded | Healthy | ✅ Fixed |

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Data Protection Protocol**: Zero data loss achieved through careful planning
2. **Container Design**: `restart: unless-stopped` policy enabled automatic recovery
3. **Volume Strategy**: External volumes preserved data through Docker restart
4. **Diagnostic Approach**: Systematic troubleshooting identified root cause quickly

### Improvements Needed
1. **Early Detection**: Need automated monitoring for runaway processes
2. **Resource Limits**: Docker Desktop needs configured resource constraints
3. **Documentation**: This incident highlighted need for formal runbook procedures

## Future Action Items

### High Priority
- [ ] Configure Docker Desktop resource limits (4 CPU cores, 6GB RAM max)
- [ ] Implement CPU usage monitoring with alerts
- [ ] Test incident response procedures quarterly

### Medium Priority  
- [ ] Evaluate Docker Desktop alternatives for production stability
- [ ] Create automated backup schedule for critical volumes
- [ ] Document standard operating procedures for Docker issues

### Low Priority
- [ ] Research Docker Desktop stability improvements
- [ ] Consider containerized monitoring stack
- [ ] Evaluate migration to cloud-based container services

## Incident Classification
**Category**: Infrastructure - Container Platform  
**Root Cause**: Software Defect - Docker Desktop Backend  
**Resolution**: Process Restart  
**Data Loss**: None  
**Service Downtime**: <3 minutes
