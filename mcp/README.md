# Model Context Protocol Integration

Strategic MCP implementation for workflow optimization and service integration.

## Overview

MCP servers act as intelligent middleware to optimize task distribution, solve access issues, and integrate external services into our development workflow.

## Strategic Objectives

1. **Solve Repository Access Issues** - Enable Codex CLI access to private repositories
2. **Optimize Development Costs** - Route tasks to appropriate AI services based on complexity
3. **Automate Business Processes** - Integrate GoHighLevel CRM and marketing automation
4. **Streamline Content Management** - Automate documentation and public content publishing

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Repository Access MCP (Active Development)
**Status:** Ready for implementation  
**Priority:** High - Solves immediate Codex "Failed to create task" issue

- GitHub authentication bridge for Codex CLI
- Repository caching and analysis
- Error handling and retry logic
- **Implementation Guide:** `setup/repository-mcp.md`

### Phase 2: Task Router MCP (Planned)
**Status:** Design complete  
**Priority:** Medium - Cost optimization through intelligent routing

- Task classification engine (complexity-based routing)
- Gemini CLI integration for lightweight tasks
- Load balancing and result aggregation
- Cost monitoring and optimization

### Phase 3: GoHighLevel MCP (Planned) 
**Status:** Strategy defined  
**Priority:** Medium - Business automation integration

- GHL API integration and webhook processing
- n8n workflow → GHL automation triggers
- Contact and opportunity management
- Customer journey automation

### Phase 4: CMS Integration MCP (Future)
**Status:** Conceptual  
**Priority:** Lower - Content automation

- Automated content publishing from repository
- Documentation synchronization
- SEO optimization and metadata management
- Public-facing content workflows

```

## Quick Start

1. **Review Strategy:** Read `MCP_STRATEGY.md` for complete implementation plan
2. **Phase 1 Setup:** Follow `setup/repository-mcp.md` for immediate repository access solution
3. **Environment Setup:** Configure GitHub and OpenAI API tokens
4. **Integration:** Deploy MCP server alongside existing Docker infrastructure

## Development Guidelines

- All MCP servers follow standardized authentication patterns
- Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Structured logging and monitoring
- Docker-based deployment for consistency
- Security-first approach with encrypted credential storage

## Expected Benefits

- **Immediate:** Resolution of Codex repository access issues
- **Short-term:** 30-50% cost reduction through intelligent task routing
- **Medium-term:** Automated business processes and improved efficiency
- **Long-term:** Comprehensive workflow optimization and content automation
